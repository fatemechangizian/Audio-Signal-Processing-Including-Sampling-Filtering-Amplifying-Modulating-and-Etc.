# Audio-Signal-Processing-Including-Sampling-Filtering-Amplifying-Modulating-and-Etc.

This is the class project designed for the "Computer Applications in Control" course in Winter 2018 (2nd semester/Academic year: 2017-2018)

1. The program records a voice using the computer microphone (record the voice when read this sentence loudly: “I am a student of the computer applications in control course in shiraz university. We learn LabVIEW during this semester and this is our first project in this course.”) and then save that as a main signal.

a) Plot the signal on the graph chart or waveform chart.

b) Save signal as a 2d array on an excel file.



2. The program loads the recorded file. For each of following parts save the result as excel files and export the plots as bmp files.

a) Find the maximum and minimum frequencies of the signal.

b) Find the maximum and minimum domain of the signal.

c) Find average, RMS, power, and energy of the signal.

d) In a new .vi, compute FFT of the signal.

e) In a new .vi, convert the continuous (main signal) signal to discrete signal with 500 ms sampling time.

f) In a new .vi, amplify the signal domain.

g) In a new .vi, cut the domain of the signal.

h) In a new .vi, generate a random signal and add it to the main signal.

i) In a new .vi, filter the signal using high-pass, low-pass and band-pass filters.

j) In a new .vi, modulate the signal with a sinusoidal signal.
